						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned from the article that it is important to adjust the duration of the animations. It is bad when the change occur too fast but it is also 
								bad to have it change too slow. There are many different tools to make the animation more plesant for humans and it is up to the designers to pick 
								which ones suit their website or app more. I also learn that big changes should take a longer duration so the people can notice the change while minor 
								changes should happen faster. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is when the article provide various way of how different animation functions can work to make a difference in the user
								experience. We can see what is prefered than the ones that are not as good. This is important because it help me distinquish why I should pick one over 
								another when designing websites and animations.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "You need to remember that regardless of the platform the duration of the animation should depend not only on the traveled distance but also on the size of the object. Smaller elements or animation with small changes should move faster. Accordingly, the animation with large and complex elements looks better when it lasts a little longer." </p>
