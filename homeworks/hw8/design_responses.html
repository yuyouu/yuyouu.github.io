					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Something that I learned from this article is that while design are meant to make people's life better but if it is 
							used in the wrong way, it can mislead the consumers. While it can help the deginer reach their goal but this is not a 
							good way to persuade their viewers. Those designs are called Dark Patterns and although they can be powerful but they 
							can also be dangerous! </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article is when they mention that Dark Pattern does not only exist in the UX Ui world but also 
							in our daily life. We might not usually notice those dark pattersn but they are created to help the designer to reach
							a goal of their own. Designers are suppose to "help shapes the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have
							significant impacts on the wat we as a society behave." I also like the different examples they provided since I saw a lot
							of Dark Patterns that exist that I am not aware of.  </p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
