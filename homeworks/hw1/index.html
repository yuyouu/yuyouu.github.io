            <li>One thing that I learn from the article is that there are many good websites/apps out there for people to use and sometimes one can learn a lot from other people's products. When seeing cool features from other people, one can learn by trying to figure out how and why they write that code and how it might help one's own website/app.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article is when the publisher mention to "Don't just use apps, study them". I have never thought of that before since I was simply using the app and the content the app provide but never question why and how the creater of the app create such an app.</li>
            <li>My favorite quote is: "As you watch each component build upon the next, be curious about everything you see and think through the choices that had to be made for this product."</li>
            <li>My rating is 6</li>
