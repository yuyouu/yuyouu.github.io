						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from this article is that UI designs are not simply about making things pretty. User interaction and participation toward the designs are also 
								very important. There are many factors such as closure and symmetry that may help user interaction with the websites. For example. since human brains will automatically
								try to fill in missing informations so when things are not closed as it should be, there will be more communication and connection with the users that are using the websites.
								Another thing that can be important is proximity, as it is being mentioned in the article, white space allow the users to graspse the ideas faster and make it easier to read.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article is the part that they mention the fouy key ideas of Gestalt. Those forms are Emergence, Refication, Multistability, and invariance.
								I fint it very cool because I never know that there are so much things that can affect how our brain receive the messages. With different techniques, designs can make it 
								easier to deliver to the users.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience. Gestalt principles are always current helping us achieve these goals; creating a pleasant experience for the users and a great success for the business." </p>
