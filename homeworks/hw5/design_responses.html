                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learn that UI interactions can make the user experience better as it allow the website or app user to interact with it. It makes it more fun to work with and attract more users as they can "communicate" with the website. Antoher thing that is important is that UI 
                                interactions can be cool but it can not be over fancy where it lose it's purpose. When it is too fancy, the users can not focus on the content of the website or the app which lose the purpose of the website or the app.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite is seeing different UI designs that have relly cool intereationn. It make me realize that although the plain the simple websites are usable but they are too boring for users and they do not attract as much users as the ones that interact with the users.
                                Another thing that I like is how different interactions serve a different purpose to the audience where I can see that in the variey of examples. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorits one is the neflix one. It is my favorite because it serve as a promotion for the film they are trying to promote. With that blurry and dark color choice, it makes it creepy and make mw atn to explore the film. Although notmally the bluriness would be consider
                                as a bad thing in design, in this case and for this purpose to create that creepy environment, it serve a great purpose and do what they want it to do. There is no really bad tools but only bad users. </p>
