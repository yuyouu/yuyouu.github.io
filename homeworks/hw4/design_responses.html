						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that designer for websites should not solely rely on the colors. There are people in the world that have color disability that can not distinquise between different
								color. Therefore it is important for the designers to realize that they also have to find alternative ways to do what they want to do other than using colors to express it. There are varies other methods
								such as just adding a text discription to help the ones that are color blind. </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is when they talk about different ways to help the people with color disability but also be able to use different 'colors'. It is important for there to be contrast so the 
								people with weak color distinquise ability can also see the different between the two objects that the designer want to show. I also like how the article provide resources for the designers to make their 
								website more color accessible.
