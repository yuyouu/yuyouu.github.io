							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something interesting that I learned from the article is that fonts that are chosen are suppose to 
								serve a purpose. Depending on what we want to do and the purpose of our design, we might need to 
								choose different fonts. For example, if we want to emphasize out image that we have, we might want 
								to use very simple fonts so the audience will focus on the image. Fonts that are chosen should
								also think about their targeted audience as some audience such as kids can easily read some fonts
								and does not understand the complicated but fancy ones.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article is when they introduce examples with differents fonts that serve different
								purposes. By giving those exmaples I can see how fonts might influence how the audience like me see the post. 
								Another part that I like is when they also point how how the font size can also have different meanings because
								I have never thought of that. Also that there are golden ratios for the fonts sizes being used.  </p>
