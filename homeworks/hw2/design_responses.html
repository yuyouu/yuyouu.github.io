					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from the article is that it is not always the more the better,
								sometimes empty spaces can make things look more clear and simple to understand. Another
								thing that I learned is that a rule for spacing should be a multiple of 8 pixels. The rule 
								is meant so the audience of the website can see visual consistency. The empty spaces also 
								provide a focus for the thing that is surrounded by the white space since there is nothing
								distracting the audicnes's attention.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favotite part of this artivle is the section where it provide examples showcase the 
								importance of white space and how it affect the audiences. When I see the difference
								examples, I can clearly feel the difference of having more white space contrasting with
								websites where things are more stick together. It demonstrate why "the more the better" is 
								wrong. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Users will scroll and scroll some more. I promise you. There is this myth that users will not
								a;ways scroll to see all the content on a page." </p>
						</li>
